        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="paragraphs reveal">
            <p>I am a self-taught Pet Portrait & Wildlife Artist living near the Somerset/Dorset border who has a passion for drawing animals and wildlife in detailed coloured pencil.</p>
            <p>I have always had a big love for drawing since I was a young child. Not often was I seen without a pencil in hand, drawing anything I could to try and improve on my skills. After college, I worked as a Graphic Designer for 15 years which meant my 'traditional' drawing skills weren't really as well utilised, but then I began drawing again a few years later after finding my love for it again. Inspired so much by the amazing artists that I saw on social media platforms, I was really spurred on to take my drawing more seriously. With that steely determination behind me, I made notes of what materials and pencils these artists were using and made some arty investments, so that I had what I needed to make a bigger improvement. It has to be said that materials and pencil quality do definitely make a difference to what quality of work you can produce. Without those things, you really do restrict the progress that you can make.</p>
            <p>The rest really, is history. Every drawing I did, gave me more experience and I learnt and improved with each piece. Gradual improvements were made over a few years and I began to be able to see more details and colour where I hadn't done before.</p>
            <p>Due to ongoing chronic health problems, I had to give up my part-time jobs a couple years ago and as a result, I decided to try and pursue my art as a career. It means I can work when I'm able to, and if I'm having a bad day, (more often than not), I don't have to. It's not been easy, but I have been fortunate enough to sell many pieces to buyers both here and abroad â€“ many of whom are returning customers, which I hope is testament to the quality and value of my work. </p>
            <p>I spend most of my time in my little art studio at home, drawing and selling my wildlife art, as well as undertaking regular commissions for Pet Portraits. A lot of my artwork is also made into professionally printed greetings cards, prints and calendars and I am always looking for new ways to expand my business. </p>
