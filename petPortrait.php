            <p style="text-align: center;">Currently booked up until January/February 2025. Commissions currently open.
            Detailed Coloured Pencil Portraits (Head & Neck/Partial Chest). Please message to enquire about pricing.</p>
            <h5 style="font-weight:900;">Photographs</h5>
            <p>If you would like a Pet Portrait created, all I need is a good quality, high-resolution photograph of your beloved animal. Photographs taken in natural daylight are best and I am happy to reference from more than one photograph if it gives a better understanding of your pet’s personality. The better the quality of the photograph, the more detail I can impart into the drawing and the more I can capture the physicality and character of your pet. My drawings are very highly detailed, therefore, unclear photographs do not lend themselves to my drawing style. Please do not take offence if I initially reject photographs that you supply - this is purely because I know what I am looking for in order to do credit to the portrait. The eyes need to be open and facial details must be easy to see.</p>
            <h5>Medium & Timings</h5>
            <p>Drawings will be produced in Faber Castell Polychromo coloured pencils on Bristol paper, Pastelmat or Toned Paper and will consist of head, neck and top of chest. This can take anything from approx 25-40 hours to complete - in some cases, longer. Please allow up to 8 weeks for full completion of your portrait; however, this may be more at busier times of the year (particularly in the run up to Christmas). Portraits will only be worked on in the order in which they are booked in and if your portrait is to be gifted for a particular date, please make this clearly known at the time of booking. Full body drawings can also be undertaken, but please contact me to discuss details further and to secure a quote, as these will take a lot longer to produce and will cost a lot more.</p>
            <h5>Payment & P&P</h5>
            <p>From January 2024, I will be taking a £30 non-refundable deposit to secure a booking slot. This will be deducted from your final bill once you have signed off the final artwork. Payment must be made via PayPal once you have seen images of the completed drawing via email/messaging and are happy with it. If you do not have a PayPal account, I can send a link via PayPal which can then be paid for on a credit/debit card. Finished portraits will be signed and wrapped, ready to gift if you so wish. UK Postage prices are standard at £10 as all portraits will be posted out by Royal Mail (next day, tracked and insured) Special Delivery in order to guarantee no losses. Overseas P&P will have to be quoted for at time of booking.</p>
            <h5>Advertising</h5>
            <p>I always show recent artworks on my social media platforms in order to promote my drawings, however, if your portrait is for a gift, you can rest assured that nothing will be shown until the portrait has been gifted to the recipient. Other portraits which are not surprises may well be shown at work in progress stages - with client approval.</p>
            <h5>©Copyright</h5>
            <p>As the portrait will be an original artwork that I have created, I will own the copyright on the drawing, however, I will not make any prints of your portrait to sell, but I may well use images of the drawing for advertising purposes on social media and at art/craft fayres.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 2rem; text-align: center;">Some examples below of Pet Portrait commissions. I can draw any pet/animal and also take commissions for wildlife work.
